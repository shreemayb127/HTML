    <p><B>Q1.How many headings are there</B>Answer.HTML provides six levels of headings, from h1 to h6. Each level has a different default font size and semantic importance, with h1 being the highest level (most important) and h6 being the lowest level (least important).</p> 
    <p><B>Q2.H1 can be used how many times</B>Answer.The h1 tag should ideally be used once per page to denote the main heading or title of the document. While technically you can use it multiple times, it is recommended to use it only once for semantic and accessibility reasons. Additional sections should use other heading levels like h2,h3, etc.</p> 
    <p><B>Q3.What is self closing tag, empty tag and void tag B Answer.Self-closing tag: An HTML tag that does not need a closing tag. In XHTML and some modern HTML practices, these are written with a slash before the closing angle bracket, like br/ . However, in HTML5, they can be written as br.</p> <br>
    Empty tag: An HTML tag that has no content between the opening and closing tags. Many self-closing tags are also empty tags, such as br and img, but empty tags can also have attributes.<br>
    Void tag: Another term for self-closing or empty tags. These tags cannot have any child elements or text content. Examples include br, img, and hr.
    <p><B>Q4.Why we use br tag</B>Answer.The br tag is used to insert a line break in the text. It is useful for breaking lines within content without starting a new paragraph.</p> 
    <p><B>Q5.Why we use hr tag</B>Answer.The hr tag is used to create a thematic break or horizontal rule in the content. It visually separates sections of content, typically used to indicate a shift in topic or a change of context within a page.</p> 
    <p><B>Q6.What is marque tag</B>Answer.The marquee tag is used to create scrolling text or images within a web page. It is a non-standard HTML element and is not recommended for use because it is not supported in HTML5 and is generally considered outdated and problematic for accessibility and usability. Instead, CSS animations or JavaScript are preferred for creating similar effects.</p> 
    <p><B>Q7.Difference between block line and inline element. </B>Answer.Block-level elements:<br>
        Start on a new line and take up the full width available.
        Examples include div, p, h1 through h6, ul, li, form.
        Can contain other block-level elements or inline elements.<br>Inline elements:<br>

        Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
        Examples include span, a, img, strong, em.
        Can contain only other inline elements or text.</p> 
    <p><B>Q8.Div and span tag difference</B>Answer.div tag:

        A block-level element.
        Used to group larger chunks of HTML and apply styles or scripts to entire sections of a document.
        Can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.
        span tag:<br>
        
        An inline element.
        Used to group smaller chunks of HTML within other block-level or inline elements.
        Typically used for styling a portion of text or other inline elements within a paragraph or other container.</p>
